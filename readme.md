#### Themes (you will be assessed on this)

* Software best practices (proper encapsulation and functions)
* product focus
* deploy models
* project scoping -- independence

#### Rough timeline 

* Wednesday: Project scoping, Model building, and an intro to Web apps
* Thursday: Web app and deployment

#### Deliverables

* model (properly commented and encapsulated on Github with a README)
* exposed API
* Data visualization (extra)

#### Assessment

* You will be assessed both on quality and cleanliness of code
* as well as a well functioning solution

#### Notes

* [building your model](model_notes.md): notes on how to get started with the dataset and how to save your model once you've trained it.
